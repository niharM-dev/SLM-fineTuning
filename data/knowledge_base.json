      "description": "ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system. The framework is built around a risk-based approach where organizations identify assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, and select controls that reduce risk to an acceptable level. It emphasizes leadership commitment, clear scope definition, and evidence-based documentation that can be audited. The standard aligns governance, policy, and operational procedures into a single management system so that security decisions are traceable and repeatable. It requires organizations to define objectives, assign responsibilities, and measure performance through internal audits and management review. The Annex A control set, while no longer a strict checklist, provides a comprehensive menu of security topics such as access control, cryptography, physical security, supplier management, and incident response. ISO 27001 also stresses continual improvement, which means lessons learned from audits, incidents, and metrics are fed back into updates of policies, controls, and training. For compliance mapping, ISO 27001 provides a stable taxonomy to map other frameworks, policies, and controls because it is principle-driven and widely adopted across industries and geographies. Its strength is the integration of governance, operational controls, and continual improvement within a single, certifiable standard that can be used to demonstrate mature security practices to regulators, partners, and customers."
